# Code of Conduct

* If you happen to have any issues with the mod, please communicate them in its Discord Server (Link at the bottom of the [Readme](https://github.com/TheBlueTemplar/Path_Of_The_Vattghern_Public/blob/main/README.md))
* If you for some reason still post in [issues](https://github.com/TheBlueTemplar/Path_Of_The_Vattghern_Public/issues), or interact in any other place of this gihub repo, please at least make sure to express yourself in a decent manner.
* Currently, any redistribution of the mod is strictly prohibited, as per its [License](https://github.com/TheBlueTemplar/Path_Of_The_Vattghern_Public/blob/main/LICENSE.md)
   * If you see any version of PoV not exactly the same as the one I have in this github, then it is considered a "pirated" version, shared without my permission
   * In such case, I would appreciate if you would privately report this to me
