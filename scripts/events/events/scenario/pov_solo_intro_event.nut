It does not take long for you to understand that this is no simple contract, but a land in chaos. \n\n Savages in the north, the undead clawing their way back to life, noble houses locked in endless feuds, religious conflict brewing, whispers of orcish hordes uniting, unspeakable horrors stalking the wilds, and now a new threat, mutants, making their appearance. \n\n You know very well that this is no coincidence, and you can feel something horrible being brewed for the future. \n\n You set forth on [color=" + this.Const.UI.Color.povEvent + "]the Path of the Vatt\'ghern[/color], alone, and maybe with a chosen few in the future.
