You feel unease, you have no idea how anyone could access this space, but the note seems strangely familiar, did you write it? Is there some discreet benefactor trying to help? You decide to read it: %SPEECH_ON% To tap into the potential of the mutagens, you need to make the mythical \"Trial of the Grasses\". To craft it you need: an adrenaline gland, sulfurous rocks, a third eye, a poison gland, a nachzehrer\'s brain and an unhold\'s heart, along with distilled alcohol as a catalyst.  %SPEECH_OFF% The list keeps going, getting into the intricate details on how to prepare the potion and the one to ingest it. You do not understand why anyone would help you with this, but it is help all too appreciated. You now know what you need to do next. \n\n [color=" + this.Const.UI.Color.povEvent + "] You have unlocked the recipe for \"The Trial of the Grasses\", along with a new ambition to get a \"Vattghern\". You also unlock some useful events.[/color]}"
