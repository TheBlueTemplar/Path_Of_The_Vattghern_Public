### PoV

The mod begun as a spiritual successor to "TLW" (The Last Witchers) mod, which we rewrote, and then I kept adding more and more. Currently, it stands on its own as a substantial overhaul/content mod, with quite a few things on the way. Priority is given to keep PoV as compatible as possible with other submods, as well as to strike a balance between challenge and fun.  

### Main features:
* **Vatt'ghern** - A powerful mid-late game upgrade for any mercenary, granting access to powerful scaling buffs and effects, special skills, contracts and more! Tied to most of the mod's mechanics
* **Mutations** - Mutagenic effects are not just limited to the player, but enemies can also spawn with them, granting them new skills and effects, along with visuals
* **Corpses** - Most enemies can drop corpses, that can be dissected in the crafting tent to yield resources (some exclusive to them, like special mutagens!)
* **Enemies** - Currently having expanded the ghost (geist) enemy type, with 9 New enemies (one is with 7 different variants), all with custom effects, skills, sounds, art and visuals.
* **Events** -  (and encounters): 32 Total and counting, in an effort to provide narrative and immersion. Some of PoV's mechanics are even "locked" behind certain milestone events
* **Starting Scenarios** - 3 Different ones, for different tastes (solo start, OP start, normal start), all fitting their niche. 
* **New Items and Weapons** - Quite a few new items and weapons to complement a player's options
* **Overhauled Mechanics** -  Including new monster effects, fire damage, the injury system etc.
