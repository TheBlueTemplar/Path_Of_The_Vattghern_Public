### PoV

The mod begun as a spiritual successor to "TLW" (The Last Witchers) mod, which we rewrote, and then I kept adding more and more. Currently, it stands on its own as a substantial overhaul/content mod, with quite a few things on the way. Priority is given to strike a balance between challenge and fun, and to keep some reasonable level of compatibility with other legends Submods.  

### Main features:
* **Overhaul** -  PoV is also an overhaul mod, touching many different aspects of vanilla and legends. Some of these aspects include: *Injury System, Fire Damage, New Monster Effects, Armor Attachments, Monster Trophies, Skills, Perks, Traits, Backgrounds, Shields, Ranged Weapons, Skill Books, and much more!*
* **Vatt'ghern** - A powerful mid-late game upgrade for any mercenary, granting access to powerful scaling buffs and effects, special skills, vattghern signs, contracts and more! Tied to most of the mod's mechanics
* **Mutations** - Mutagenic effects are not just limited to the player, but enemies can also spawn with them, granting them new skills and effects, along with visuals
* **Corpses** - Most enemies can drop corpses (almost 50 currently), that can be dissected in the crafting tent to yield resources (some exclusive to them, like special mutagens, or crafting items!)
* **Enemies** - 20 Enemies total added to the mod! Expanding the geist, undead, noble, mercenary and bandit factions currently! And of course, with more on the way!
* **Skills** - More than 35 Skills added, including special mutagen skills, vattghern signs and weapon skills!
* **Events** -  (and encounters): 45 Total and counting, in an effort to provide narrative and immersion. Some of PoV's mechanics are even "locked" behind certain "story" events
* **Starting Scenarios** - 3 Different ones, for different tastes (solo start, OP start, normal start), all fitting their niche. 
* **New Items and Weapons** - Quite a few new items like weapons, armor, shields, ammo and accessories to complement a player's options (Currently: 25 Items)
* **Contracts** - Currently including 2 and counting. Special strong encounters, that do require the assistance of all the goodies PoV has to offer!
* **Other Additions** - Include a new retinue, new player background, settlement situations, music, enemy locations, ambitions, and more...

### And now, for some additional numbers:
**PoV's Total Additions**
* **160 Items**, including corpse items, autopsies, weapons, shields, ranged weapons, potions, accessories, armor, helmets, loot etc.
* **130 Different effects**, including new racial ones, buffs, debuffs, mutagens etc.
* **60 New Crafting Recipes**, which you understand why, if you play the mod
* **50 Custom Sound Effects**, for all the different additions
* **840 (!) Different Art Pieces**, regarding item, skill, effect, event, battle and world sprites and other kinds of art

**PoV's Overhaul Changes**
* **120 Items**, including shields, ranged weapons, loot, drops, helmets, armors, accessories, monster trophies and others. All tweaked for PoV's vision
* **160** Skills, Effects, Racials, Traits, Backgrounds etc., again, all tweaked for PoV
* **Practically ALL Enemies (>200)**, for the enemy mutation and corpse system, and many new effects that PoV adds
* And these numbers would be even higher, if I included the optional hooks for Fotn, MC, Rotu, and SSU
