# Player Mutations
*Some Important Notes:*
* `base` mutations are the normal ones you get in your playthrough. Only consumable by the `Vatt'ghern` and `Mutant`. Affected By Mutation Limit
   * They are obtainable by: Dissecting Corpses, Getting them as loot drops from enemy mutants, and buying them from Alchemists and Black Markets. Some PoV starting scenarios also start with a random base mutagen 
* `upgrade` mutations are upgrades to their "base" effect versions. Upon consumption, they replace the original mutation with a stronger version. Does NOT count to mutation Limit
   * They are only obtainable by: Dissecting Corpses of powerful enemies (like the white direwolf)
* `special` mutations are mutations that do not follow the same rules as the other ones (between a meme and actual mutations). You cannot get them from dissecting corpses (most of the time), and their effects do not follow the same pattern as other mutations. Does NOT count to mutation limit.
   * They are only obtainable by: Loots drops, low chance, from specific enemies
* The `Mutant` background can only consume *some* of the base mutations, and the special mutations. From the base mutations, the ones excluded are: Hexe, Necromancy, Rot
* Also, the effects of mutations on the mutant usually have slightly weaker benefits, and stronger penalties. Most also dont grant access to their Added Skills in that case.
* A player can only have ONE active Hexe mutation in the company!
